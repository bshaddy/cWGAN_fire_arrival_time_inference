This directory contains the codes needed to preprocess VIIRS AF measurements into the form required for use as input to the trained cWGAN. The VIIRS AF data and the associated preprocessed measurements used for the work presented in the associated manuscrupt are also contained within this directory. Details about the codes and data are provided below:

The MATLAB function measurement_constructor_SOD_func.m is designed to take as input the location of a fire of interest, ignition day as Julian day, VIIRS AF confidence level cutoff to be used in constructing measurement, and the location of VIIRS AF datafiles which have been collected from the NASA LAADS DAAC website for a fire of interest. Output of this function is a composite measurement image containing AF locations and their corresponding measurement times. The output file is named as <confidence_levels_used>_confidence_measurement_from_SOD.mat.

The Python notebook data_formater_real_fire.ipynb takes outputs from the MATLAB function measurement_constructor_SOD_func.m and puts them into the form required for use as input to the trained cWGAN. Outputs from this code have the naming structure <confidence_levels_used>_confidence_<fire_name>_SOD.npy.

This directory also contains a subdirectory for each of the fires analyzed in the associated manuscript. These subdirectories contain: the VIIRS AF measurements used for this work (in netCDF format), the composite measurement ouputs from the MATLAB function measurement_constructor_SOD_func.m for each confidence interval, and the composite measurement outputs that have been formatted for use as input to the trained cWGAN by the Python notebook data_formater_real_fire.ipynb.
